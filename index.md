On Friday, March 29, Chicago ML and HERE Technologies is hosting a
half day workshop on ML applied engineering. The half day is
structured around three topics:

- Identifying and communicating value to business stake holders
- ML model selection and training strategies
- Automation and reproducibility

Each topic is covered by one or more short presentations by experts
followed by a panel discussion. Audience members participate through a
question and answer session.

The purpose of the workshop is to share knowledge and experience
within the community and to define an ongoing set of problems for
further work.

If you would like to participate in the workshop as a presenter,
    please contact Garrett Smith &lt;g@rre.tt&gt;.
