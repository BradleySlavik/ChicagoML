description for the event, even if it's a preliminary concept.

Provide description content in this order:

- Differentiator - "what it is" - readers should understand what makes
  the event different from other events by reading the first
  sentence. This should align closely with the title.

- Benefit - "what's in it for me" - readers should understand what
  they'll get from the event if they go.

Keep the description short and sweet. Talk descriptions will provide
more info.
