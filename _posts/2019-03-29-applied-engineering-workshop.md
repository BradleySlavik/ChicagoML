On Friday, March 29, Chicago ML and HERE Technologies are hosting a
half day workshop on ML applied engineering. The half day is
structured around four topics:

- Identifying and communicating value to stake holders
- ML model selection and training strategies
- Automation and reproducibility
- Deployment and production

Each topic is covered by one or more short presentations by experts
followed by a panel discussion. Audience members participate through a
question and answer session.

The purpose of the workshop is to share knowledge and experience
within the community and to define an ongoing set of problems for
further work.

If you would like to participate in the workshop as a presenter,
    please contact Garrett Smith &lt;g@rre.tt&gt;.

The workshop covers essential topics in machine learning that you can
apply to your work as a machine learning engineer or
researcher. Presenters are experts in their field and share openly
about their successes and failures so that we collectively advance our
knowledge. Importantly, you meet others doing similar work and build
outstanding professional and social connections!
