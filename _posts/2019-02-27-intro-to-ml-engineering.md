What is machine learning engineering? It’s a new field that combines
the science and methods of machine learning with traditional software
and systems engineering. In this talk, Garrett Smith, founder of Guild
AI, will present the challenges and opportunities for practitioners
who want to apply machine learning to build exciting new
applications. Garrett will cover the motivation for using machine
learning in applications, tools of the trade, data analysis, model
selection, model training, infrastructure, reproducibility, and
production. All of these topics roll into complex, deep, and
fascinating areas of work. If you’re a software programmer or engineer
looking to get into machine learning, you’ll learn what’s involved in
expanding your skillset into the realm of machine learning. If you’re
a machine learning scientist or researcher, you’ll learn about the
engineering processes needed to support your work in building
applications.

Garrett Smith is founder of Guild AI, an open source toolkit for
running, tracking, and comparing machine learning experiments. He is
also co-organizer of Chicago ML and TensorFlow Chicago. He has over 20
years experience building software and systems. Prior to his work on
Guild AI, Garrett built and ran CloudBees application platform, which
hosted tens of thousands of enterprise applications at scale.

We will also host short presentations by members of the community on
projects they're working on:

- Aman Agarwal - Use of Transfer Learning in Text Classification using
  FastAI library. Till now, transfer learning was mainly used in
  computer vision but FastAI is a wrapper library built around PyTorch
  that has brought this state-of-the-art approach in NLP tasks. I will
  be demonstrating the use of this library for US-Airline Sentiment
  Analysis.
- Jay Rodge - Classifying Audio-MNIST using PyTorch.
