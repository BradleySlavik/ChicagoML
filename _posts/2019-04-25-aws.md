This is our second joint meetup with AWS Chicago User Group. We
feature AWS EC2 for training a variety of models, demonstrating EC2's
ability to scale from small, less costly K80 GPUs up to fantastically
powerful DGX-1 super computers!

While GPU accelerators on EC2 are not free, when used selectively they
can be cost effective alternatives to buying and maintaining dedicated
hardware.

Schedule:

5:30 - Welcome and pizza brought to you by CreditNinja
6:00 - Presentations
7:00 - Networking and delightful social exchange

This event is hosted by CreditNinja. The Blue Lacuna concept is a
revolutionary approach to the work and play superstructure that
focuses on collocating highly creative and entrepreneurial
organizations with community-based programming.
