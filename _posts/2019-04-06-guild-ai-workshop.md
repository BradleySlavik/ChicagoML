This is a deep dive into using Guild AI to build and optimize machine
learning models.

For more information on Guild AI - see https://guild.ai

Guild AI is a tool for running, capturing, and tracking machine
learning experiments. It's used by researchers to systematically
improve models using both intuition and AutoML methods such as
Bayesian optimization.

The workshop will focus on model development and optimization. We will
cover these topics:

- Basic model training
- Data preprocessing
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Comparing training results
- Debugging models
- Collaboration
- Remote training

This is a technical, hands-on workshop in ML model development. We
encourage you to bring your projects along to work on directly. If you
are new to machine learning, we will provide a sample project that you
can use during the workshop.

This workshop is geared for students and researchers though it is open
to everyone regardless of education background. We do recommend that
you have some experience with Python and a basic understanding of
machine learning as we will not cover these during the workshop.

Please note, lunch is NOT provided at this event. As this is over the
lunch hour, please feel free to bring lunch items with you.
